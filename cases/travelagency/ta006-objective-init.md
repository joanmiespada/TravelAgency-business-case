# Objective

## What is the Goal?

Build sustainable ***product/platform*** to enable company partners to send to us their fees by themselves, with minimum operational support.

## Why? 

- Fees cache is always deprecated, constant refresh to be accurated
- Error in fees
- Price volatility
- GDSs, Agregattors, Airlines, ... 
- Massive volume of fees (seats, catergories, destinations, locations, etc.)
- Information disconnected
- Finding the best route is a N-PC problem
- Precompute everything in advance
