# Boostrapping 

Now, let's review the answers for our project.

---

# People  (I)
## Bootstrapping

- How many engineers do we need to start?

__The less the better!__ 

- Junior or senior engineers?  

__Keep healthy ratio 2:1__

- What growth do we expect?

__This question is misleading! LetÂ´s assume hypergrowth always!__

- What is the minimum number of people needed to protect the team's roadmap?

__I bet to start with at least 2 engineers per platform!__

# People (II)
## Bootstrapping

- How senior is the PM, my partner, in this project?

__Critical question!__

Is our duty to get a good understanding of our partner, in which areas are stronger than us and I can rely on them and where I need to increase my performance to help.
