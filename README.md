# Software Engineering Management Case Studies

One of the most valuable study techniques in Business Schools is the 'Case Study'. It is famous in business schools like MIT Sloan, IESE, ESADE, IE, etc. The lecturer creates a debate among the students to analyse the case from different points of view. This debate's objective is to improve students' knowledge and transfer the learning from senior people to young ones, allowing students and lecturers to interact/learn with a real business case.

The objective of this repo is to create a set of real case studies related to software development.

We will introduce real case studies, where we can raise several questions about the background issues. Later we will be able to propose improvements.

## Why Engineering Management?

Because the goal is to be focused on non-tech topics. This repo collects engineering management cases and doesn't want to bring tech solutions. Actually, it's far away from hard tech solutions. So, we will use the words 'Engineering Management' to emphasise that case studies are oriented to all elements non-tech related to software engineering. In the literature, you'll find tons of information about hard-topics (SRE, async messaging, software patterns, software architecture, programming languages, databases, etc...) and team management (coaching, mentoring and people management). But,  there are many other topics that, as engineers, maybe we aren't paying enough attention to, but they really matter, such as organisation, responsibilities management, roles, ownership, KPIs, OKRs, SLO, disagreements and so on. These management cases are engineering topics close to the software development lifecycle.

## How can we contribute?

Either create your own case study and shared it or add more potential solutions to the current ones. All comments are welcome, just open a PR with your feedback and let's debate about the solutions.
